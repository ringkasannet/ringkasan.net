                        With the Covid-19 Global Outbreak showing little signs of slowing down, we have to embrace the
                        inevitable reality that the Pandemic has and will continue to bring devastating impact to human
                        lives across the world. Indeed, the scale and magnitude of the global impact of the pandemic are
                        so
                        great that the IMF has called it “The Great Lockdown: a crisis like no other”.

                        One particular chart, published by the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2020/06/08/the-global-economic-outlook-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-a-changed-world">World Bank</a>, may be helpful to assist us in grasping the
                        historical significance of the unprecedented global recession brought about by the pandemic.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The chart displays data on the percentage share of countries in the world experiencing recession
                        each year going back from the 1800s.

                    <p>
                        The first thing that we can immediately observe is that the global economy is almost never
                        completely calm; there are always some countries in some region experiencing recessions in any
                        given
                        year. In fact, the annual average percentage share of countries in recession throughout the
                        years
                        based on the data is equal to 30,2%.
                    </p>

                <div class="para" id="5">
                    <p>
                        The second important inference we can make is that the global economy since the late 20th
                        centuries
                        has been relatively calmer compared to the periods before World War II.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="para" id="6">
                    <p>
                        If we loosely define the event of “large scale international recession” as periods during which
                        there are more than 50% of countries in the world (hence the majority of countries) that are
                        experiencing recession each year, we can readily perceive that episodes of large scale
                        international
                        recessions are in fact very many throughout history; albeit more frequent in the past.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="para" id="7">
                    <p>
                        From the years of the 1800s until World War II, there were many occurrences of large scale
                        recessions taking place globally. Two of these events were related to the great wars of the
                        time:
                        World War I from 1914 to 1918 and World War II from 1939 to 1945. Others were triggered by
                        various
                        aspects related to financial shocks and economic disruptions such as the Long Depression in the
                        1870s-1890s, the early 1990s recession, and including the Great Depression of the 1930s.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="para" id="8">
                    <p>
                        However, since the end of the 20th century, we have seen less of such large scale international
                        recessions. While the global economy continues to have its ups and downs, including the Asian
                        Financial Crisis in 1997/1998 these episodes tend to be concentrated in a smaller number of
                        countries. The only large scale international recession we had was the 2008/2009 Global
                        Financial
                        Crisis;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thus, prior to the year of 2020, we have been experiencing a much calmer global Economy in the
                        last
                        couples of decades. This has understandably led economists and decision makers around the globe
                        to
                        be more confident that we have in our arsenal the tools needed to maintain and restore stability
                        should economic disturbances happen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That is perhaps why, what has happened to us globally this year is beyond anyone’s expectation
                        and
                        has caught almost all of us completely off guard.

                        into
                        recession in 2020, in line with the <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2020/06/24/WEOUpdateJune2020">IMF’s</a> assessment that calls the Pandemic as “a crisis like no
                        other”, and forecasts a deep contraction of the global economy by –4.9 percent in 2020.

                        What we have this year is worse than the 2008/2009 Global Financial Crisis which was referred by the <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Books/Issues/2017/06/02/From-Great-Depression-to-Great-Recession-The-Elusive-Quest-for-International-Policy-43657">IMF</a> as
                        the
                        Great Recession: the most severe economic and financial meltdown since the Great Depression. The
                        crisis, that was initially triggered by a turmoil in the US financial market, but then spread to
                        a
                        vast number of countries in the world, had brought damages to the global economy can still be
                        felt
                        more than a decade afterward.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This coverage of effect of this year’s Pandemic is also bigger than all recessions that happened
                        in
                        the past, including the both World Wars, that also coincided with the Spanish Flu pandemic in
                        1918
                        that killed an estimated 40 million people (<a href="https://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/influenza/CSR_ISR_2000_1/en/">WHO</a>), including the Great Depression in the 1930s.
                        Comparison
                        with the Great Depression in the 1930s is particularly worrying considering the scale of
                        suffering
                        it has brought to society, not only due to its magnitude, but also its length of duration which
                        lasted for 10 years 1929 to 1939 (<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Books/Issues/2017/06/02/From-Great-Depression-to-Great-Recession-The-Elusive-Quest-for-International-Policy-43657">IMF</a>).

                    <p>
                        What makes matters worse is that the future trajectory of the global economy remains highly
                        uncertain. The majority of economists, institutions and the world’s governments operate under
                        the
                        assumption that the economy will rebound in 2021. Yet this hypothesis is made based on a very
                        shaky
                        assumption that we will very soon regain control of this pandemic either through the discovery
                        of
                        vaccines, more effective medication, or that the society can return to function normally under
                        new
                        health and social protocol.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Explanations about the severity of the pandemic’s impact to the economy have indeed been
                        offered.
                        Most of the analysis has looked at the problem through the frame of reference of economic
                        analysis;
                        which argues that the combination of supply and demand shock, which is unique to the pandemic
                        and
                        lock-down policy responses, have exacerbated its effect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, another critical aspect that we should also take into account is that the recession
                        this
                        time is not caused by deficiencies in the social and economic system that we have authority
                        over,
                        but rather due to biological agents that may not necessarily be under the direct control of
                        human
                        civilization.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall, we can and should appreciate the gravity of the situation that we as a global community
                        is
                        facing. This episode of the pandemic may signify how we have entered a new uncharted territory
                        that
                        will determine the shape of our shared future as human societies.
